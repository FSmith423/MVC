Implementation of ''Coordinates for Mean-Value Cloning'' by Farbman et al. 
(2009) for Computer Graphics (CS 155) at Harvey Mudd College.

To run, all source files should be added to a Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 
empty console project.

Image files must be Windows bitmap files (.bmp) with 1-3 channels and at 
most 8-bits per channel.


Implementation notes for using hierarchical boundary sampling:
-computation of interpolant requires knowing exactly which
 vertices in the boundary are present in the vector of mvc's
-mvc's should really consist not just of a vector of doubles
 but also the indices of the corresponding vertices in the 
 boundary vector
-typedef a mvc's as a pairing of such, or make it its own class
-modify composite to run through each interior point's mvc set of indices
 for differences in boundary (thus one single boundary difference vector)
