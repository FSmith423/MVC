        <h2> Overview of Project </h2>
        I implemented the algorithm presented by Farbman et al. in "Coordinates for Instant Image Cloning" (2009). It intelligently generates a mask-like membrane
        for a user-specified patch from a source image to clone to a destination images. My implementation offers a simple user-interface, efficient cloning using 
        hierarchical boundary optimization and the ability to do batch cloning for video stills.

        <h2> User Interface </h2>
        <h3> I/O </h3>
        <p> Upon launching the program, two windows appear, one labeled "Source" and one labeled "Target." Using the right-click, each window
        can be loaded with a .bmp image. Each window saves, reverts and prints file info independently. Each window thus has its own
		right-click menu. A help menu is accesible by both the right-click menu and by pressing 'h' on either window.
        </p>
        <h3> Selecting A Source Patch</h3>
        <p> One a source image has been loaded, using the right-click menu on the source window, under "Clone" a user can select either "Outline Patch" or 
        "Trace Patch." The former option allows the user to discretely select a few of the boundary points using the left-click and then the rest of the boundary
        is linearly interpolated. In this mode, a user can press 'z' to undo the last point. The tracing option lets the user left-click, hold and drag around the 
        patch they wish to clone.
        </p>
        <p> In either cloning technique, once a boundary vertex has been added that is sufficiently close to the original vertex, the patch will
        close and the interior of the image will automatically be computed, blacking out the rest of the image. This may take
		a few moments. While selecting the boundary,
        if the user wants to automatically close the patch, they can press 'c' and the first vertex will be connected to the last vertex to be
        addded. Note that patchs must be simple (non-intersecting) and convex for correct calculation of interior points. If the patch is not convex, then there may be error in calculating the interior, resulting in strips of falsely computed
		interiors points. Thus for best
		performance, create a convex patch, even if it means thicker borders around the desired image.
        </p>
        <p> If the user is unsatisfied with the patch area, using the menu, under "Clone" they can select "Clear Patch" and the image will
        be reverted.
        </p> 
        
        <h3> Cloning Source Patch </h3>
        <p> Once a source patch has been selected and a target image has been loaded, the user can paste the patch and perform the cloning. To do so,
        using the right-click menu on the target window, under "Clone" select "Paste Patch." Then using the mouse, left-click the point on the target
        image which will correspond to the first point in the source patch (highlighted by a yellow square). Upon clicking,
		the membrane for the patch will be generated and then pasted onto the target. This may take up to a minute. 
		A user can do this on a target image as many times
        as they want or they can remove the pasted images by clicking on "Clear Pasted Patch" under "Clone" in the menu. Additionally, for comparison,
        the user can directly paste the original source image by choosing "Naive Paste Patch" in the menu. This will simply copy the pixel images
        from the source and directly replace the correspond pixels in the target image. This feature was implemented to allow a user
        to observe the changes in cloning that the algorithm offers.
        </p>

        <h2> Implementation </h2>
        <h3> Basic Algorithm </h3>
        <p> The implementation directly follows the algorithm described by Farbman et al. The Image class from the image processor assignment
        is used as the basic data structure for images. Additional classes created include Patch, Window, and the wrapper class Membrane for the main
        algorithm. Some additional preliminary steps that were implemented but not detailed in the paper include the Bresenham algorithm for creating
        a complete boundary and a basic techinque for computing polygon interior points. 
        </p>
        <h3> Optimizations </h3>
        <p> The program implements one of the two optimizations offered by Farbman et al. It uses hierarchical boundary sampling when computing
        mean-value coordiantes, since boundary points further from an interior point have less of an influence on the resulting interpolant value.
        This was implemented by recursively going through levels of downsampled boundaries. This noticeably reduced the run-time. 
        </p>
        <h3> Video Cloning </h3>
        <p>
        After selecting a source patch and cloning location on the target window, a user can clone over a sequence of images by selecting "Run" under "Batch" 
        in the menu for either window. The user will then be prompted for information regarding the file name prefixes for both the source and target,
        the starting indices for each, the prefix for the resulting file, and lastly the number of frames to clone over. As described by Farbman et al., in 
        addition to simply cloning each pair of images, the interpolant value for each pixel is actually a weighted average of the previous interpolant values
        for smoothing.
        </p>

		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> I was able to generate results on three sets of images using both my implementation and the implementation offered
		on the paper's website, available <a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~danix/mvclone/"> here</a> under "Demos." The zipped
		file "Images.zip" on the Wiki contains two directories - one for the results from each implementation. I ran my program on 
		their sample images (polar bear and beach) and my own (another polar bear and beach and Harvey Mudd's campus). 
		I also ran their program on the additonal image sets I used. For side-by-side comparisons of the two programs
		on the same input, see the presentation uploaded to the Wiki.
		</p>
		<p> Additionally, I created a movie by batch cloning over a sequence of still images. In the movie, I use the same
		set of images for both the source and target and simply clone myself so the resulting movie features two copies of myself moving.
		The movie is named "sync.mp4" and can be played on the Wiki.

        <h2> Summary and Proposal Review </h2>
        <p> I completed all items included in my proposal except for selective boundary suppresion and run-time assessment listed under Part III. However,
        these were buffer points and the total raw points for the features I implemented is 89.
